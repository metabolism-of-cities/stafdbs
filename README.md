# Overview

This contains the skeleton for the Stocks and Flows Database Schema (STAFdbs). This is kept in a separate repository from the Metabolism of Cities (MoC) website, as there are custom changes made that are specific to the MoC website that do not necessarily make sense in other contexts. This should therefore be considered a context-neutral version of the database schema.
