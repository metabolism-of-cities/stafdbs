# Import licensing notes

Some restrictions apply to third-party components. We use High Charts as our charting library. This is free to use for non-profits, but not for commercial ventures. Consult their website for more infromation.

We furthermore use a design template called Nifty. This is a paid design template with its own licensing. If you want to set up your own derivative of this platform then you must purchase your own license or use another template.
